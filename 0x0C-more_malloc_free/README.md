This C code demonstrates memory allocation and reallocation using the malloc and _realloc functions. It allocates memory for a character array, reallocates it to a larger size, fills the allocated memory with the value 98, and then prints the contents of the allocated memory in hexadecimal format. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The code includes the necessary headers (main.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h) and defines two functions: simple_print_buffer and main.

The simple_print_buffer function is used to print the contents of a memory buffer in hexadecimal format. It takes two parameters:

buffer: A pointer to the memory buffer to be printed.
size: The size of the memory buffer.
Inside this function, a while loop is used to iterate through the memory buffer, and each byte is printed in hexadecimal format with the printf function.

The main function is the entry point of the program:

It declares a character pointer p and an integer i.
It allocates memory for p using malloc to hold 10 characters (sizeof(char) * 10).
It then calls _realloc with p, the original size (sizeof(char) * 10), and the new size (sizeof(char) * 98) to reallocate memory. This is where the p pointer is reassigned to the newly allocated memory block.
It uses a while loop to fill the allocated memory with the value 98. The loop runs for 98 iterations, assigning 98 to each element in the memory block.
Finally, it calls simple_print_buffer to print the contents of the memory buffer and then frees the allocated memory with free(p).
The output of this program will display the hexadecimal representation of 98 (0x62) repeated 98 times, indicating that the memory allocation and reallocation processes were successful. After printing, the allocated memory is freed to prevent memory leaks.
