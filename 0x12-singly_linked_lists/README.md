# print_list.c
This code defines a C function called `print_list` that is used to print the elements of a linked list. It appears to be part of a larger program since it includes an external header file "lists.h" which likely contains the data structures and function prototypes related to linked lists. The code comments provide some information about the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `#include "lists.h"`: This line includes the "lists.h" header file, which is expected to contain necessary declarations and structures for this code to work with linked lists.

2. The function `print_list` takes one argument:
   - `const list_t *h`: This is a pointer to a structure of type `list_t`. The `const` keyword indicates that the function won't modify the content of the list. `h` is the pointer to the head (or first element) of the linked list.

3. The function returns a `size_t` value, which represents the number of nodes (elements) in the linked list.

4. Inside the function:
   - `const list_t *loc = h;`: A local pointer `loc` is initialized with the same value as the head pointer `h`. This pointer is used to traverse the linked list.

   - `size_t count = 0;`: A variable `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of nodes in the linked list.

   - The code enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `loc` is not `NULL`, which means it will iterate through the linked list from the head to the end.

   - Inside the loop:
     - It checks if the `str` member of the current node `loc` is not `NULL`. If it's not `NULL`, it prints the length of the string (`loc->len`) and the string itself (`loc->str`) using `printf`.
     - If `loc->str` is `NULL`, it prints "[0] (nil)" to indicate that the string is empty.

   - `loc = loc->next;` advances the `loc` pointer to the next node in the linked list.

   - `count++;` increments the `count` variable for each node processed.

5. Finally, after the loop has processed all the nodes in the linked list, the function returns the `count` variable, which represents the number of nodes in the list.

This function is used to print the contents of a linked list, assuming that each node contains a string (`str`) and the length of that string (`len`). If a node's string is `NULL`, it is printed as "(nil)."

# 2-add_node.c
This code defines a C function called `add_node`, which is used to add a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list. It takes a pointer to the head of the list (`head`) and a string (`str`) that is to be added to the new node. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `#include "lists.h"`: This line includes the "lists.h" header file, which is expected to contain the necessary data structure definition and function prototypes for linked lists. This file likely defines the `list_t` structure and the required functions.

2. The function `add_node` takes two arguments:
   - `list_t **head`: A pointer to a pointer to the head of the linked list. This is a double pointer because the function may need to modify the `head` pointer when adding a new node.
   - `const char *str`: A pointer to a string that will be added to the new node.

3. The function returns a `list_t*`, which is a pointer to the newly created node. If the operation fails (due to memory allocation issues), it returns `NULL`.

4. Inside the function:
   - `char *loc;`, `int len;`, and `list_t *add;` declare local variables to hold a copy of the string (`loc`), the length of the string (`len`), and the newly created node (`add`).

   - `add = malloc(sizeof(list_t));`: This line allocates memory for a new `list_t` node using `malloc`. If the allocation fails (i.e., if `add` is `NULL`), it returns `NULL` to indicate an error.

   - `loc = strdup(str);`: This line duplicates the input string `str` using the `strdup` function, creating a new dynamically allocated string `loc`. If the duplication fails (i.e., if `loc` is `NULL`), it frees the previously allocated memory for `add` and returns `NULL`.

   - A `for` loop calculates the length of the string by iterating through each character of `str` and incrementing the `len` variable accordingly.

   - The `str` and `len` members of the `add` node are assigned the values of `loc` and `len`, respectively.

   - `add->next = *head;` sets the `next` pointer of the new node to point to the current head of the list.

   - `*head = add;` updates the `head` pointer to point to the newly added node, effectively making it the new head of the list.

   - The function returns the address of the new element (`add`), which represents the newly created node.

This function is used to add a new node to the beginning of a linked list, and it takes care of memory allocation and copying the input string, making it suitable for building and maintaining a singly linked list.

# 3-add_node_end.c

This code defines a C function called `add_node_end`, which is used to add a new node at the end of a singly linked list. It takes a pointer to the head of the list (`head`) and a string (`str`) that is to be added to the new node. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `#include "lists.h"`: This line includes the "lists.h" header file, which is expected to contain the necessary data structure definition and function prototypes for linked lists. This file likely defines the `list_t` structure and the required functions.

2. The function `add_node_end` takes two arguments:
   - `list_t **head`: A pointer to a pointer to the head of the linked list. This is a double pointer because the function may need to modify the `head` pointer when adding a new node.
   - `const char *str`: A pointer to a string that will be added to the new node.

3. The function returns a `list_t*`, which is a pointer to the head of the linked list. If the operation fails (due to memory allocation issues), it returns `NULL`.

4. Inside the function:
   - `char *loc;`, `int i;`, and `list_t *add, *last;` declare local variables to hold a copy of the string (`loc`), the length of the string (`i`), the newly created node (`add`), and a pointer to the last node in the list (`last`).

   - `add = malloc(sizeof(list_t));`: This line allocates memory for a new `list_t` node using `malloc`. If the allocation fails (i.e., if `add` is `NULL`), it returns `NULL` to indicate an error.

   - `loc = strdup(str);`: This line duplicates the input string `str` using the `strdup` function, creating a new dynamically allocated string `loc`. If the duplication fails (i.e., if `loc` is `NULL`), it frees the previously allocated memory for `add` and returns `NULL`.

   - A `for` loop calculates the length of the string by iterating through each character of `str` and incrementing the `i` variable accordingly.

   - The `str` and `len` members of the `add` node are assigned the values of `loc` and `i`, respectively.

   - `add->next = NULL;` sets the `next` pointer of the new node to `NULL` since it's being added at the end.

   - The code then checks if the list is empty (i.e., if `*head` is `NULL`). If it's empty, the `head` pointer is updated to point to the newly created node (`add`), making it the new head of the list.

   - If the list is not empty, it iterates through the list to find the last node by starting from the head and following the `next` pointers until it reaches the end. Once the last node is found, it updates its `next` pointer to point to the newly created node, effectively adding the new node at the end of the list.

   - The function returns the address of the head of the list (`*head`).

This function is used to add a new node at the end of a linked list, and it takes care of memory allocation and copying the input string. If the list is initially empty, it updates the head pointer, and if not, it traverses the list to find the last node and adds the new node to the end.
