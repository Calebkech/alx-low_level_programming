# print_list.c
This code defines a C function called `print_list` that is used to print the elements of a linked list. It appears to be part of a larger program since it includes an external header file "lists.h" which likely contains the data structures and function prototypes related to linked lists. The code comments provide some information about the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `#include "lists.h"`: This line includes the "lists.h" header file, which is expected to contain necessary declarations and structures for this code to work with linked lists.

2. The function `print_list` takes one argument:
   - `const list_t *h`: This is a pointer to a structure of type `list_t`. The `const` keyword indicates that the function won't modify the content of the list. `h` is the pointer to the head (or first element) of the linked list.

3. The function returns a `size_t` value, which represents the number of nodes (elements) in the linked list.

4. Inside the function:
   - `const list_t *loc = h;`: A local pointer `loc` is initialized with the same value as the head pointer `h`. This pointer is used to traverse the linked list.

   - `size_t count = 0;`: A variable `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of nodes in the linked list.

   - The code enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `loc` is not `NULL`, which means it will iterate through the linked list from the head to the end.

   - Inside the loop:
     - It checks if the `str` member of the current node `loc` is not `NULL`. If it's not `NULL`, it prints the length of the string (`loc->len`) and the string itself (`loc->str`) using `printf`.
     - If `loc->str` is `NULL`, it prints "[0] (nil)" to indicate that the string is empty.

   - `loc = loc->next;` advances the `loc` pointer to the next node in the linked list.

   - `count++;` increments the `count` variable for each node processed.

5. Finally, after the loop has processed all the nodes in the linked list, the function returns the `count` variable, which represents the number of nodes in the list.

This function is used to print the contents of a linked list, assuming that each node contains a string (`str`) and the length of that string (`len`). If a node's string is `NULL`, it is printed as "(nil)."
