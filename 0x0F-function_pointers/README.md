# 0x0F-function_pointers

## 0-print_name.c

This code is a C program that defines a function called `print_name` which takes two arguments: a string `name` and a pointer to a function `f`. This function is designed to print the provided `name` using the function pointed to by the pointer `f`. The code includes a header file named "function_pointers.h" and the standard input/output library header "stdio.h".

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `#include "function_pointers.h"`: This line includes a user-defined header file named "function_pointers.h". This header likely contains function prototypes or declarations related to function pointers, which are used in this code.

2. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input/output library header. It is included because the code uses functions like `printf` and `NULL` from the standard library.

3. `/**
 * print_name - print name using pointer to function
 * @name: string to add
 * @f: pointer to function
 * Return: nothing
 **/`: This is a documentation comment, often used to describe the purpose and usage of a function. It provides a description of the `print_name` function and its parameters.

4. `void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *))`: This is the function definition for `print_name`. It takes two parameters:

   - `name`: A pointer to a character (string) that represents the name to be printed.
   - `f`: A pointer to a function that takes a `char*` argument and returns `void`.

   The purpose of this function is to pass the `name` to the function pointed to by `f` for printing. The use of a function pointer (`f`) allows flexibility in determining how the name is printed. Different functions can be passed as `f` to achieve different printing behaviors.

5. `if (name == NULL || f == NULL) return;`: This line checks whether either the `name` or the function pointer `f` is `NULL`. If either of them is `NULL`, it means that the function cannot be executed safely. In such cases, the function returns without performing any action.

6. `f(name);`: If both `name` and `f` are valid (not `NULL`), the code calls the function pointed to by `f` and passes the `name` as an argument. This effectively invokes the function pointed to by `f` with the provided `name`.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how function pointers can be used to invoke different printing functions based on the context. You can call `print_name` with different printing functions as `f` to customize the way a name is printed without changing the `print_name` function itself.

## 1-array_iterator.c

This C code defines a function called `array_iterator`. It takes three arguments:

1. `array`: A pointer to an integer array.
2. `size`: A size_t variable representing the number of elements in the array.
3. `action`: A pointer to a function that takes an integer as an argument.

The purpose of this function is to iterate through the elements of the `array` and apply the provided `action` function to each element. If either the `array` or `action` is `NULL`, the function returns without performing any actions to ensure safe execution.

The `for` loop iterates through the elements of the array, and for each element, the `action` function is called with the element as an argument. This allows you to customize the behavior of the function by passing different action functions as needed, such as printing elements in regular or hexadecimal format, depending on the function pointed to by `action`.

## 2-int_index.c

This C code defines a function called `int_index`. It takes three arguments:

1. `array`: A pointer to an integer array.
2. `size`: An integer representing the number of elements in the array.
3. `cmp`: A pointer to a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer.

The purpose of this function is to search for an element in the `array` by applying the `cmp` function to each element. If the `cmp` function returns a true value for any element, the index of that element is returned. If the `array` is `NULL`, `size` is less than or equal to zero, or `cmp` is `NULL`, the function returns -1 to indicate an error or that no matching element was found.

The `for` loop iterates through the elements of the array, and for each element, the `cmp` function is called. If the `cmp` function returns a true value (non-zero), the index of the current element is returned. If no element matches the condition specified by the `cmp` function, the function returns -1 to indicate that no matching element was found.

## 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h

This C program is designed to perform simple mathematical operations based on command-line arguments. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `#include "function_pointers.h"`: This line includes a user-defined header file named "function_pointers.h." It's likely used for function prototypes or declarations related to function pointers.

2. `#include <stdlib.h>`: This line includes the standard library header for `stdlib.h`, which provides functions like `atoi` and `exit`.

3. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard library header for `stdio.h`, which provides functions like `printf`.

4. `#include "3-calc.h"`: This line includes a user-defined header file named "3-calc.h." It's likely used for function prototypes or declarations related to a calculator program.

5. `int main(int __attribute__((__unused__)) argc, char *argv[])`: This is the `main` function, the entry point of the program. It takes two arguments: `argc` (the number of command-line arguments) and `argv` (an array of pointers to the arguments).

6. `if (argc != 4)`: This condition checks whether there are exactly 4 command-line arguments (including the program name). If not, it means the user hasn't provided the expected input, and an error message is printed.

7. `num1 = atoi(argv[1]);`: This line converts the first command-line argument (the left operand) to an integer and assigns it to the variable `num1`.

8. `op = argv[2];`: This line assigns the second command-line argument (the operator) to the variable `op`.

9. `num2 = atoi(argv[3]);`: This line converts the third command-line argument (the right operand) to an integer and assigns it to the variable `num2`.

10. `if (get_op_func(op) == NULL || op[1] != '\0')`: This condition checks two things:
    - It uses the `get_op_func` function (presumably defined elsewhere) to check if the specified operator `op` is valid. If it returns `NULL`, an error message is printed.
    - It checks if the operator is a single character (the second condition `op[1] != '\0'`). If it's not a single character, it's considered an invalid operator, and an error message is printed.

11. `if ((*op == '/' && num2 == 0) || (*op == '%' && num2 == 0))`: This condition checks if the operator is either division (`/`) or modulo (`%`) and if the right operand is zero. In such cases, it prints an error message and exits the program.

12. `printf("%d\n", get_op_func(op)(num1, num2));`: This line calculates the result of the operation by calling the appropriate function pointed to by `get_op_func(op)` and passing the `num1` and `num2` as arguments. The result is printed to the standard output.

13. `return (0);`: The `main` function ends with a return statement, indicating successful execution of the program.

This program is a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations based on the provided command-line arguments.

## 100-main_opcodes.c

This C program is designed to print the opcodes (machine code instructions) of its own executable code. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard library header for `stdio.h`, which provides functions like `printf`.

2. `#include <stdlib.h>`: This line includes the standard library header for `stdlib.h`, which provides functions like `atoi` and `exit`.

3. `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`: This is the `main` function, the entry point of the program. It takes two arguments: `argc` (the number of command-line arguments) and `argv` (an array of pointers to the arguments).

4. `if (argc != 2)`: This condition checks if there is exactly one command-line argument provided (in addition to the program name). If not, it means the user hasn't provided the expected input, and an error message is printed. The program exits with a non-zero status code (1) to indicate an error.

5. `bytes = atoi(argv[1]);`: This line converts the command-line argument (a string representing the number of bytes to print) to an integer and assigns it to the `bytes` variable.

6. `if (bytes < 0)`: This condition checks if the value of `bytes` is negative. If it is, it means the user has provided an invalid input, and an error message is printed. The program exits with a non-zero status code (2) to indicate an error.

7. `arr = (char *)main;`: This line casts the `main` function to a character pointer and assigns it to the `arr` variable. This effectively points to the beginning of the program's machine code instructions.

8. The `for` loop iterates through the opcodes and prints them in hexadecimal format:
   - `printf("%02hhx ", arr[i]);`: This line prints the opcode at index `i` of the `arr` array in hexadecimal format. The `%02hhx` format specifier is used to print two characters (bytes) in hexadecimal with zero padding.
   - The loop continues to print each opcode until the specified number of `bytes` has been printed.

9. The program returns 0 at the end of the `main` function, indicating successful execution.

This program essentially takes a number of bytes as input and prints the opcodes of its own executable code up to the specified number of bytes in hexadecimal format. It's a simple example of self-inspection for a C program.
